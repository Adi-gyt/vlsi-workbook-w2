# Week 2 — BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling  

In **Week 0**, I set up my environment and tools. In **Week 1**, I dived into the basics of Verilog, ran my first RISC-V core (RVMYTH) simulations, and got comfortable with Icarus Verilog and GTKWave.  

Now in **Week 2**, I moved one step further into **System-on-Chip design** by working with **BabySoC** — a minimal RISC-V based SoC that ties together the RVMYTH CPU, a PLL, and a 10-bit DAC.  

The main focus was to perform **pre-synthesis functional simulations** and understand how hardware modules interact when actual software runs on the CPU.

## What I produced this week
- Notes on the underlying SoC theory (this write-up).  
- Functional simulation logs + `.vcd` waveforms.  
- GTKWave screenshots with short explanations.

## What is a SoC?

A **System-on-Chip** basically puts the main parts of a computer—CPU, memory, interconnect, and peripherals—onto a single chip.  
In real life this makes devices smaller, cheaper, and more efficient. BabySoC is stripped down so that we can actually see how each part works in simulation.

## Key Blocks in BabySoC

- **RVMYTH CPU** — executes instructions.  
- **Memory** — small ROM/RAM for instructions and data.  
- **Bus** — connects CPU to peripherals with simple handshakes.  
- **DAC (10-bit)** — memory-mapped peripheral that converts digital values into analog output.  
- **PLL** — gives a stable system clock.  
- **Reset logic** — makes sure the CPU starts cleanly.

## Why It’s a Good Teaching Model

- Simple enough to follow, but still a real SoC.  
- Every important signal (reset, clock, PC, bus, DAC) is visible in waveforms.  
- Simulations run fast so iteration is quick.  
- Shows the link between **software instructions → hardware signals → real output** (like sound).

## Functional Modelling (Before Synthesis)

## Functional Modelling Flow

The idea here is to check if the design works functionally before worrying about timing or gates.

**Benefits:**
- Find design bugs early.  
- Quick turnaround compared to gate-level sims.  
- Lets me see how code running on the CPU drives hardware.  

**Tools I used:**
- `iverilog` + `vvp` for simulation.  
- `gtkwave` for waveform viewing.

## Simulation Flow (What I Did)

1. Installed/used `iverilog`, `vvp`, `gtkwave`.  
2. Compiled top-level modules (`vsdbabysoc.v`, `rvmyth`, `avsddac`, `avsdpll`, `testbench.v`).  
3. Made sure `$dumpfile` and `$dumpvars` were in the testbench:  

   ```verilog
   initial begin
     $dumpfile("pre_synth_sim.vcd");
     $dumpvars(0, testbench);
   end
   ```

4. Ran:

   ```bash
   iverilog -I src/include -o build/pre_synth_sim.out \
     src/module/testbench.v \
     src/module/vsdbabysoc.v \
     src/module/rvmyth_avsddac_stripped.v \
     src/module/avsddac.v \
     src/module/avsdpll.v

   vvp build/pre_synth_sim.out | tee build/sim_log.txt
   ```

5. Opened the VCD in GTKWave and looked at:

   * `clk`, `pll_locked`, `reset`
   * `pc`, `instr`
   * `addr`, `we`, `wdata`, `valid`, `ready`
   * `RV_TO_DAC_bits`, `OUT`

## Waveform File
Download and open in GTKWave: [pre_synth_sim.vcd](./pre_synth_sim.vcd)

## Common Debugging Notes

* **Empty VCD?** Add `$dumpfile`/`$dumpvars` at top level.
* **Duplicate modules?** Check for multiple includes.
* **Port mismatch?** Double-check top-level connections.
* **DAC flat output?** Likely CPU isn’t running → check reset & PC signals.

## Takeaways

* Understood how a simple RISC-V SoC ties CPU, PLL, DAC, and bus together.
* Learned why functional modelling is important before synthesis.
* Practiced running a full simulation → logs → VCD → waveforms.
* Got comfortable debugging common testbench issues.
* Saw how software (lookup table + timer) directly creates hardware output (DAC writes → sound).
